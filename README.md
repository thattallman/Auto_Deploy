# Auto Deploy 


Auto Deploy automates GitHub project deployment. React.js powers the frontend, while Express.js manages backend tasks. Docker and AWS Elastic Container Service orchestrate containerized deployment, with Amazon S3 storing project files. Redis and Socket.IO enable real-time updates. A proxy server efficiently routes users to their deployed projects. This stack ensures seamless deployment, scalability, and real-time communication for enhanced project management.
